To manage the full selection of resources, provide a user token from an account with appropriate permissions.

There are several ways to provide the required token:

* **Set the `POSTHOG_TOKEN` environment variable**. The provider can read the `POSTHOG_TOKEN` environment variable and the token stored there to authenticate.
